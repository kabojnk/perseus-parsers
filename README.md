# perseus-parsers

The goal behind this project is to process some of the Perseus XML data into a looser syntax, JSON, mainly for the purpose of storing data in a NoSQL database.

I am doing this for personal projects, but willing to leave the utility work here so anyone else wanting to parse this data doesn't have to reinvent the wheel.
