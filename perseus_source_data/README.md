## Data Sanitization

Odds are there are duplicate XML files for each "work" being parsedâ€”1) the original file, and 2) the sanitized file (with the `_sanitized` suffix in the filename). The sanitized file has undergone preprocessing to ensure that XML parsing happens without a hitch (and prevents having to spare the memory to do this on the fly in the JS).
